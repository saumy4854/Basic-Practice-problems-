# Basic-Practice-problems-
- So basically what is done here is to learn my first alogrithms in C programming language.
- This includes all my codes that i do to learn a certain algo then solve questions on the topic.
- This helps me develop my concepts strong enough to do my upcoming topics with pre build basic concepts and algorithms,hence making programming smooth for a new person to the programming world like me comfortable with codes.
- Here I upload my codes in irregular basis due to some academic scenarios. But will upload codes on a regular interval soon!
